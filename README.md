| [33mShoot Gun By shooting a gun, this hero shoots a gun at the enemy. The enemy gets shot with the gun, and the shooting of the gun damages the shot enemy who was shot with the gun. Shoot Guns are 75% stronger than non-shoot guns and they also critical shoot 20% more often, as long as they are shoot guns when they shoot. Shoot guns are light, because of how shoot of a gun they are, and because of this, this hero shoots their gun 20% faster. Nonetheless, it sure is a shoot gun.[39m | [36mSilver‚≠ê
